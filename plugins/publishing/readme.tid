Tools for using a Node.js based ~TiddlyWiki to publish standalone versions of itself. Currently just a button which works like "download", but yields a wiki containing only tiddlers tagged `public` (plus system tiddlers).

! known bugs
If the recipient of the published wiki uses Firefox with the ~TiddlyFox plugin installed, re-exporting will overwrite the wiki with the public part instead of asking for a new filename.
